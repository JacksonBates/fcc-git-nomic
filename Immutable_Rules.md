# Universal Constants

## UC1 - Rule Proposal via Pull Request Only
Rules can only be proposed as changes to this file (RULES.md) via Github Pull Requests. This file (RULES.md) is the single source of truth for rules in this game.

## UC2 - Code of Conduct
A rule, a proposal, action, or any discussion taking place relating to this game in any forum or channel must abide by the FreeCodeCamp [Code of Conduct](https://freecodecamp.org/code-of-conduct).
Code of Conduct violations should be reported to the repository maintainer, or any other agent later empowered by subsequent rule changes, and their judgment and enacted consequences will be final.

# Immutable_Rules

## 1 - Initial Rule-set
Rules are divided into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones.

## 2 - Rule-Change
A rule change may be:
  * the addition of a new mutable rule
  * an amendment to a mutable rule
  * the repeal of a mutable rule
  * the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable
  * or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable

## 3 - Rule Formatting
A rule shall be formatted according to the example demonstrated by this rule. That is, a short title is provided, using a `##` level header which includes the proposed rule number.
A longer description of the scope and effects of the rule shall be included underneath.

## 4 - Rule Numbering
A rule should be numbered sequentially according to the last accepted rule.
In the case were multiple rules are proposed that share the same proposed rule number, the maintainer, or any other agent later empowered by subsequent rule changes, will manually amend the rule numbers when merging pull requests, according to the order in which the rules were accepted.
In cases where rules are accepted at the same time, the decision will be based on when the rule was proposed.
