# Mutable_Rules


## 1 - Citizenship Rights
A player cannot propose a new rule if there are any outstanding proposals they have not personally cast a vote on. They must check the open Pull Requests and cast votes. If the number of votes required to pass or reject a rule have already been cast, they do not need to vote.

## 2- Rule Acceptance
Players cast their votes by commenting on open Pull Requests.
Players cannot cast votes for rules they've proposed.
Players on cast their votes should tell which type this rule should be considered[Immutable or not] in case they are in favor of this rule.
A rule must be accepted by vote before it is passed into effect.
A rule passes if it receives 3 votes in its favor.
A rule cannot pass if there are 3 votes against it, and in case of equality of votes the rule kept in pull request case another 48 hours [from the time of the last vote casted] in case a new vote came in favor of it or an old voter changed his vote, and this is the only case in which players allowed to change their vote.
After 48 hours if the votes still in equality case the rules considered rejected.

## 3 - Stickers
If a rule is accepted, the player that proposed it will be awarded a 3x3cm hexagonal laptop sticker.
The number of stickers will be tracked on the wiki.
(The stickers exist in-game only, unfortunately)
