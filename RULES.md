# Universal Constants

## UC1 - Rule Proposal via Pull Request Only
Rules can only be proposed as changes to this file (RULES.md) via Github Pull Requests. This file (RULES.md) is the single source of truth for rules in this game.

## UC2 - Code of Conduct
A rule, a proposal, action, or any discussion taking place relating to this game in any forum or channel must abide by the freeCodeCamp [Code of Conduct](https://freecodecamp.org/code-of-conduct).
Code of Conduct violations should be reported to the repository maintainer, or any other agent later empowered by subsequent rule changes, and their judgement and enacted consequences will be final.

# Immutable_Rules

## 1 - Initial Rule-set
Rules are divided into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones.

## 2 - Rule-Change
A rule change may be:
  * the addition of a new mutable rule
  * an amendment to a mutable rule
  * the repeal of a mutable rule
  * the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable
  * or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable

## 3 - Rule Formatting
A rule shall be formatted according to the example demonstrated by this rule. That is, a short title is provided, using a `##` level header which includes the proposed rule number.
A longer description of the scope and effects of the rule shall be included underneath.

## 4 - Rule Numbering
A rule should be numbered sequentially according to the last accepted rule.
In the case were multiple rules are proposed that share the same proposed rule number, the maintainer, or any other agent later empowered by subsequent rule changes, will manually amend the rule numbers when merging pull requests, according to the order in which the rules were accepted.
In cases where rules are accepted at the same time, the decision will be based on when the rule was proposed.

# Mutable_Rules

## 1 - Citizenship Rights
A player cannot propose a new rule if there are any outstanding proposals they have not personally cast a vote on. They must check the open Pull Requests and cast votes. If the number of votes required to pass or reject a rule have already been cast, they do not need to vote.

## 2- Rule Acceptance
Players cast their votes by commenting on open Pull Requests.
Players cannot cast votes for rules they've proposed.
Players on cast their votes should tell which type this rule should be considered[Immutable or not] in case they are in favor of this rule.
A rule must be accepted by vote before it is passed into effect.
A rule passes if it receives 3 votes in its favor.
A rule cannot pass if there are 3 votes against it, and in case of equality of votes the rule kept in pull request case another 48 hours [from the time of the last vote casted] in case a new vote came in favor of it or an old voter changed his vote, and this is the only case in which players allowed to change their vote.
After 48 hours if the votes still in equality case the rules considered rejected.

## 3 - Stickers
If a rule is accepted, the player that proposed it will be awarded a 3x3cm hexagonal laptop sticker.
The number of stickers will be tracked on the wiki.
(The stickers exist in-game only, unfortunately)

## 4 - Dub Thee 'Hunter of Bugs'
Any player that raises a valid issue relating to the repo, such as typos, or improvements to the CONTRIBUTING.md, will receive the Title 'Hunter of Bugs'.
This rule applies retroactively.

## 5 - Bugs in Your Code
If a rule is rejected, the player that proposed the rule will have gained a software bug!
Bugs are tracked on the wiki.
