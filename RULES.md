# Universal Constants

## UC1 - Rule Proposal via Pull Request Only
Rules can only be proposed as changes to this file (RULES.md) via Github Pull Requests. This file (RULES.md) is the single source of truth for rules in this game.

## UC2 - Code of Conduct
A rule, a proposal, action, or any discussion taking place relating to this game in any forum or channel must abide by the freeCodeCamp [Code of Conduct](https://freecodecamp.org/code-of-conduct).
Code of Conduct violations should be reported to the repository maintainer, or any other agent later empowered by subsequent rule changes, and their judgement and enacted consequences will be final.

# Rules

## 1 - Rule Formatting
A rule shall be formatted according to the example demonstrated by this rule. That is, a short title is provided, using a `##` level header which includes the proposed rule number.
A longer description of the scope and effects of the rule shall be included underneath.

## 2 - Rule Numbering
A rule should be numbered sequentially according to the last accepted rule. 
In the case were multiple rules are proposed that share the same propsed rule number, the maintainer, or any other agent later empowered by subsequent rule changes, will manually amend the rule numbers when merging pull requests, according to the order in which the rules were accepted.
In cases where rules are accepted at the same time, the decision will be based on when the rule was proposed.

## 3 - Rule Acceptance
A rule must be accepted by vote before it is passed into effect. A rule passes if it receives 3 votes in its favour. A rule cannot pass if there are 3 votes against it.
Players cast their votes by commenting on open Pull Requests. Players cannot cast votes for rules they've proposed.

## 4 - Citizenship Rights
A player cannot propose a new rule if there are any outstanding proposals they have not personally cast a vote on. They must check the open Pull Requests and cast votes. If the number of votes required to pass or reject a rule have already been cast, they do not need to vote.

## 5 - Stickers
If a rule is accepted, the player that proposed it will be awarded a 3x3cm hexagonal laptop sticker.
The number of stickers will be tracked on the wiki.
(The stickers exist in-game only, unfortunately)

## 6 - Bugs in Your Code
If a rule is rejected, the player that proposed the rule will have gained a software bug!
Bugs are tracked on the wiki.

## 7 - Rule-Changes and New Rules
The adoption of new rules and rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

## 8 - Dub Thee 'Hunter of Bugs'
Any player that raises a valid issue relating to the repo, such as typos, or improvements to the CONTRIBUTING.md, will receive the Title 'Hunter of Bugs'.
This rule applies retroactively.

## 9 - Squish Bugs
If a player has accumulated bugs in their software, they can pay another player with the title 'Hunter of Bugs' to remove the bug for them at a cost of ONE sticker which will be paid directly to the 'Hunter of Bugs'. A player cannot remove their own bugs, even if they are also a 'Hunter of Bugs'
